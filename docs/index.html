      <h2>A. T. Cross</h2>
      <p>The company is named after Alonzo Townsend Cross, born in 1846, in Birmingham, England.</p>
      <p>Cross launched its first ballpoint pen in 1952. The ballpoint was so immediately successful that Cross stopped making fountain 
         pens entirely. Cross did not produce another fountain pen until 1982, when it launched the Century.</p>
      <p>In 1972, the company went public on the American Stock Exchange</p>
      
      <h2>Aurora</h2>
      <p><em>Fabbrica Italiana de Penne a Serbatoio-Aurora</em> was founded in Torino in 1919.
      One of Aurora's competitive strengths was in its colourful barrels (compared to most fountain pens which were monochromatic during 
        this era). In 1925 Aurora began producing pens with vivid celluloid barrels.</p>
      <p>In 1943, Aurora's entire facility was destroyed during the bombing of Turin.<p>
      <p>After the war's end, many Americans were seen with the radical-looking Parker 51 which inspired Aurora to produce the Aurora 88, 
        which it launched in 1947 and has been its most well-known model ever since.</p>
      
      <h2>Montblanc</h2>
      <p>August Eberstein founded the <em>Simplizissimus-Füllhalter</em> company in Berlin in 1906.<p>
      <p>In 1910, the company started putting a white tip on the end of its pen caps. By 1914, this tip had morphed into the trademarkable 
        'star' that has characterised Montblancs ever since. Although known as a star, the six-pointed design element actually represents 
        the snow-covered tip of Mont Blanc</p>
      <p>In 1924, Montblanc introduced the <em>Meisterstück</em> branding.</p>
          
      <h2>Parker</h2>
      <p>George Safford Parker was born in 1863</p>
