      <h2>A. T. Cross</h2>
      <p>The company is named after Alonzo Townsend Cross, born in 1846, in Birmingham, England.</p>
      <p>Cross launched its first ballpoint pen in 1952. The ballpoint was so immediately successful that Cross stopped making fountain 
         pens entirely. Cross did not produce another fountain pen until 1982.</p>
