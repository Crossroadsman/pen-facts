      <h2>A. T. Cross</h2>
      <p>The company is named after Alonzo Townsend Cross, born in 1846, in Birmingham, England.</p>
      <p>Cross launched its first ballpoint pen in 1952. The ballpoint was so immediately successful that Cross stopped making fountain 
         pens entirely. Cross did not produce another fountain pen until 1982, when it launched the Century.</p>
      <p>In 1972, the company went public on the American Stock Exchange</p>
      
      <h2>Parker</h2>
      <p>George Safford Parker was born in 1863</p>
